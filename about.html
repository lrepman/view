  <h1>Dreamer, Coder, Doer</h1>
  <p>I dream of a world full of kind, compassionate, strong, imaginative, free people who respect differences and find ways to agree to disagree in the pursuit of raising kindness and enabling people from various cultures to co-habitate in good health, with pure water, clean air, sustainable soil, green energy. I believe in a world where combat is done for fun, like with pokemon's. I believe that there are enough people who want a healthy world of peace, stability, and freedom with good health for all. I have 18 months experience and am able to write and debug for Java and SQL, depending on whether it's coding or database. I am able to navigate in Unix/Linux operating systems. I am developing my website building skills for both front and back of the house operations, including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I created this website and have designed others. I look forward to working with other like-minded folks who are working to keep our planet healthy, kind, and sustainable, for now and future generations.</p>
