  <p>Staying <em>ProActive</em> with the <strong>Coronavirus</strong></p>
  <p>I am a student, a mother, and a humanitarian. In response to the coronavirus and its ability to spread, I have created this website to provide my researched guidelines based on reducing the spread of germs. I sum it up with an air high five, because in these times of virtual hugs and air high-fives, we need to take the role of germ-prevention very seriously. I hope you find comfort and some humor in these times, keeping the power of a positive mind in sight. Here's to all of our health.</p>
